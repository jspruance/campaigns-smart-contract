# campaigns-smart-contract
A voting-based dApp for approving campaign funds usage.

Users contribute Eth to a campaign of their choice (think decentralized version of Kickstarter). This contribution gives the user voting rights on whether or not campaign funds should be spent on a specific thing. The ower of the campaign can initiate a specnding request, which is approved only if authoized by a majority of the voters. If the request is authorized, the smart contract releases the funds to the address of the intended recipient.
